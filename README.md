## 🚶‍♂️ My journey

**This clone was the first project I made all by myself.** Back in the day, **all I knew was pure HTML, CSS and JS, so that's what I used to build it.** It most definitely contributed to developing my logical skills and strengthening my web development fundamentals.

That said, the code for the entire application is in ***3 files***, and despite the obvious architectural flaws, I am very proud of the outcome I managed to achieve back then.



## 💻 Installation


```bash
git clone https://github.com/Maymisk/pomofocus-basic-clone.git
# no dependencies, this was hardcore
```
Then, just open the index.html file in your web browser!

## ✅ Functionalities

- Task creation, checking and deletion
- 3 different timers:
    - ⚰ 25 minute timer - (the time you should focus for!) 
    - 😌 5 minute timer - (a short break)
    - ☕ 15 minute timer - (a long break)
- Cycle counting
- Different themes and Minecraft sound FX!! 🟦

**Despite pointing out these potential improvements, I have no intention of committing to this repository anymore. It'll stay this way as a mark of my evolution.**
