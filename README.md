# Pomofocus Clone

This is a clone of the [**pomofocus webapp**](https://pomofocus.io), which helps its users to keep track of their study time, following the [**pomodoro technique**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).



## My journey

**This clone was the first project I made all by myself.** Back in the day, all I knew was pure HTML, CSS and JS, so that's what I used to build it. It most definitely contributed to developing my logical skills and strengthening my web development fundamentals. *(it also made me feel like quitting, since coding imperatively was not fun ðŸ’€).*

That said, the code for the entire application is in ***3 files***, and despite the obvious architectural flaws, I am very proud of the outcome I managed to achieve back then.



## Installation


```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Maymisk/pomofocus-basic-clone.git
  
  # no dependencies, this was hardcore
```
Then, just open the index.html file in your web browser!

## Functionalities

- Task creation, checking and deletion
- 3 different timers:
    - âš° 25 minute timer - (the time you should focus for!) 
    - ðŸ˜Œ 5 minute timer - (a short break)
    - â˜• 15 minute timer - (a long break)
- Cycle counting
- Different themes and Minecraft sound FX!! ðŸŸ¦

## Improvements

- Give life to the navbar buttons - so far there are no settings, as well as no login and no reporting functionalities;

- Finish the task related functionalities;

- Make the modal accessible;

- Make the application responsive so the layout doesn't break on smaller screen sizes;

- The code should be distributed accross many more files ðŸ’€ðŸ’€.

**Despite pointing out these potential improvements, I have no intention of committing to this repository anymore. It'll stay this way as a mark of my evolution.**
